== Description ==

This plugin aims to help Wordpress users or developers to add - very easily -  several UI elements to their websites, including 3D components and layouts based upon the work of the [W3D project](http://w3d.mba-multimedia.com/).

Thanks to dedicated admin settings screens and a powerful shortcode system, creating, customizing and adding complex elements to a Wordpress website is really fast and intuitive. The plugin offers a wide range of components from sliders to HTML layouts.

The plugin will help people to customize their Wordpress site even if they don't know HTML, CSS or PHP. Developpers who know these languages will be able to customize the plugin by adding their own stylesheets or templates. Various WP filters are also available to help wordpress developers customizing HTML output.
